        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <p>
            It is a style sheet language that determines how documents written in markup languages such as HTML are actually represented on websites.
            C of CSS stands for Cascading, which means inheriting the style attributes of the parent element to the offspring element
            This is because it resembles the appearance of falling like a waterfall in the DOM tree structure. However, as an exception, the box model-related attributes such as margins, padding, and boarders are
            It is not inherited. Of course, it can be forcibly inherited by giving an inheritance value. In the past, it was common to include design elements in HTML.
            In other words, by putting all kinds of layout and design information into HTML, it has become a document for design, not a structured document, which is the original purpose of HTML.
            Due to the fact that the &lt;table&gt; tag was used to form a layout, it was difficult for even experts to know what kind of document this was based on HTML source code.
            Accordingly, W3C released CSS with the aim of "Let's create structured HTML by completely separating design elements from HTML!" 
            Accordingly, elements related to design in HTML, such as bgcolor, such as bgcolor.
            After the CSS announcement, new tags such as divan, Span, and span, and protection
            Style tags, such as Strike, Font, and patterns were deleted from HTML5.Table
            As recommended to express the data, tbody, tbody attitude was newly introduced to help structuralization.
            structured HTML tag is used to suit the use of HTML tags. 
            For example, the &lt;h1&gt; tag, which means the top title, is written at the title level of the document, and the body paragraph is divided by the &lt;p&gt; tag.
            HTML is much easier to recognize because this excludes most design elements. 
            Here, "easy to recognize" includes not only people (programmers) but also machines (web browsers).
            HTML, which is easy for machines to understand, is easy to change the output format to various formats (CSS files for mobile, PC, etc.)
            It is applied in a way that each person prepares and replaces, which speeds up the decoding (parsing) of documents and makes it easier to implement dynamic functions. 
            And in most cases, structured HTML is relatively smaller in document size than previous unstructured HTML.
            This makes the distinction of use clearer because the CSS is dedicated to the design,
            Collaboration between web designers and web programmers will also be easier. In addition, CSS can be inserted into HTML documents within &lt;style&gt; tags
            It is also possible to separate into separate files, so the same CSS can be used in other HTML. In other words, if you create web page,
            If you save stars, you can change the contents of all pages related to the web page, you can change the content at once
            There is a effect of keeping consistency and reduce traffic time. 
            However, CSS has different differences in HTML, even if you have different differences or grammar
            It is necessary to practice and practical experience.In particular, Internet Explorer Kooberjeon (6~7)
            There are many cases that output other results. Because of this, when working to support IE 6 and 7, the CSS has a bunch of nuclei
            You can see it coming in. This is because support for the latest CSS standard (version 2.1) was only properly achieved in IE8.
            Safari took over the post in the 2010s.
            CSS is more grammatical than HTML.
            Even if you make a mistake to skip only one shoe, you will fail to load the entire CSS file.
            Therefore, when editing CSS, it is a good idea to use an IDE or code editor that can verify the accuracy and integrity of the code.
            In addition, if several CSS grammar is inherited for a single object, the grammar described later is followed.
            Of course, you can first control the grammar that should be applied first!
            But using Important is a bad habit and should be avoided to make debugging more difficult by breaking natural subordination in the style sheet.
            The CSS manifest also has a different priority depending on how CSS is brought in, but the individual tag's style=" ... " The inline style has a separate priority, 
            and the &lt;style&gt; tag usage (internal style) and the &lt;link&gt; tag usage (external style) reflect the attributes that are described later, such as those above. However, it is important to check in a Web browser, 
            as it can happen depending on the Web browser or the network environment.
